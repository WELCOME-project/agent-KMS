# agent-KMS
The discourse relation tool can be used for identifying 
relations between two adjacent utterances of a user. More specifically, it can recognize 
four major types of discourse relations (temporal, contingency, comparison, and expansion) as well as 
the absense of a relation between the utterances. 

## Requirements
`Java=11.0.18` 
`Eclipse RDF4J Server and Workbench=3.7.7` 

## Installation 
To use the agent-KMS, you need to clone the repository locally and 
create a war file as follows:
```
$ cd kms
$ mvn clean package
```
To create a docker image, you need to place the Dockerfile and
the generated war file in the same folder and run:
```
$ docker build -t kms-spring .
```

In addition, you need to install Eclipse DF4J Server and Workbench
as follows:
```
$ docker pull eclipse/rdf4j-workbench:3.7.7


## Run 
You can run the application with the following command 
```
$ docker run -d --restart always --name kms-spring kms-spring
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xms1g -Xmx4g" \
	-v data:/var/rdf4j -v logs:/usr/local/tomcat/logs eclipse/rdf4j-workbench:latest
```
